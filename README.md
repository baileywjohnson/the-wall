# the-wall

This project is a mock social media (single-page) app featuring client-side routing that was written in vanilla JS.  The app is not currently attached to any data stores as it's only meant to showcase the ability to create routes and manage parameters client-side without the use of any JS library/framework.

The app can be viewed live [here](https://the-wall-spa.herokuapp.com/) or built locally by cloning the repository, running <code>npm install</code> to pull down the Node.js dependencies, and running <code>node server.js</code> to start the app server (which is set by default to run on port 3000).
