# the-wall

This project is a mock social media (single-page) app featuring client-side routing that was written in vanilla JS.

The app can be viewed live [here](https://the-wall-spa.herokuapp.com/) or built locally by cloning the repository, running <code>npm install</code> to pull down the Node.js dependencies, and running <code>node server.js</code> to start the app server (which is set by default to run on port 3000).
